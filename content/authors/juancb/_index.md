I build AI tools that make quantum computing accessible to developers. As AI for Quantum Product Owner at IBM Quantum, I lead products like qiskit-ibm-transpiler and Qiskit Code Assistant—an LLM trained on quantum code.

My work sits at the intersection of quantum computing, machine learning, and open source. I hold IBM Master Inventor status and have contributed to tools used by millions of developers worldwide.

Background: PhD in Computer Engineering (University of Salamanca, 2018), 80+ publications, 2019 SCIE-BBVA Award for best young researcher in Computer Science in Spain.
