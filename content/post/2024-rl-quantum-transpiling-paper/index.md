Excited to share research demonstrating the integration of Reinforcement Learning (RL) into quantum transpiling workflows for the Qiskit transpiler service! 🚀

This work achieves near-optimal circuit synthesis and routing with significant performance improvements over traditional optimization methods like SAT solvers.

Key achievements:
✅ Linear Function, Clifford, and Permutation circuit synthesis up to 65 qubits
✅ Substantial reductions in two-qubit gate depth for routing up to 133 qubits
✅ Performance advantages over SABRE routing heuristics
✅ Practical efficiency for quantum transpiling pipelines

This research represents a major step forward in making quantum computing more efficient and accessible through AI-powered optimization.

Big thanks to the amazing team: David Kremer, Víctor Villar Pascual, Hanhee Paik, Ivan Duran Martinez, and Ismael Faro!
