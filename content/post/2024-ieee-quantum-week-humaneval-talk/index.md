Hey! If you are at the #IEEEQuantumWeek 2024, I will be talking about the Qiskit HumanEval benchmark for LLMs in the session SYS-BNCH: Benchmarking (10:00 AM – 11:30 AM EDT)

After that, I'll be around the IBM Quantum booth to chat about our AI and quantum computing initiatives. Looking forward to connecting with the community!
