I'm honored to share that I've received the [IBM Master Inventor recognition](https://www.credly.com/badges/cf8bd032-f112-4b81-9439-41011b83c090)! 🎉

This distinction is awarded to employees who have "mastered the patent process, mentored broadly, added value to IBM's portfolio and demonstrated sustained innovation leadership and service."

It's incredibly rewarding to be recognized for contributions that blend innovation with mentorship and service to the broader community. This achievement reflects not just individual effort, but the collaborative spirit of working with brilliant colleagues across IBM.

Thank you to everyone who has been part of this journey!
