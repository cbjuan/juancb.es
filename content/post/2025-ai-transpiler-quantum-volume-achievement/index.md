🚀 Great to see this progress on the quantum hardware side! 🚀

I'm also really proud of our work on the AI transpiler passes that enabled this advancement in quantum volume. When I started working with David Kremer, Ivan Duran Martinez, Hanhee Paik and Ismael Faro on these AI-powered passes, we were motivated to push the limits of transpilation to deliver the best results to our clients.

It's incredibly rewarding to see how our efforts are making real impact, like what Jay Gambetta has highlighted here.

Thanks to the entire team involved in the AI transpiler passes - Víctor Villar Pascual, Jesús Talavera Gómez, Yaiza García Martín-Mantero, Ayushi Dubal, Sanjay Vishwakarma, and many others - this kind of progress is only possible through all of our effort! 🙌🙌🙌
