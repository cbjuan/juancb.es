Las week I attended to the IEEE Quantum Week and it was a blast! 🚀🔬

I had the opportunity to witness and showcase several groundbreaking developments from IBM Quantum AI:

🔹 **Qiskit Transpiler Service**: Jay Gambetta presented impressive results showing how our AI-powered optimization passes outperformed all competitors in benchpress regarding depth and number of gates, including Qiskit itself!

🔹 **Qiskit Code Assistant**: We announced the first preview release of this innovative tool.

🔹 **Unitary Compilation Research**: David Kremer presented our work on approximate compiling of unitaries in quantum circuits using AI. We also co-delivered a tutorial on AI-powered transpiler passes.

🔹 **Qiskit HumanEval**: I had the chance to present this benchmark for evaluating quantum software development tools.

It was an incredible week of innovation, collaboration, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in quantum computing!
