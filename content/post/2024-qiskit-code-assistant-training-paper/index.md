Excited to share our research paper on training specialized LLMs for quantum computing code generation using Qiskit! 🚀

Code Large Language Models have emerged as powerful tools, revolutionizing the software development landscape by automating coding tasks. However, quantum programming presents unique challenges compared to classical coding.

Our work addresses:
- The scarcity of quantum code examples
- The rapidly evolving nature of the quantum computing field
- Custom benchmarking similar to HumanEval for quantum-specific tasks

The results are promising: our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art quantum computing models!

This research represents an important step toward making quantum programming more accessible through AI assistance.
