We've upgraded the Qiskit Code Assistant! 🚀

Last month, we introduced mistral-small-3.2-24b-qiskit, replacing granite-3.3-8b-qiskit.

## Key Improvements

✅ **Better accuracy**: The new model ranks higher across key benchmarks, including QiskitHumanEval, QiskitHumanEval Hard, HumanEval, MathQA, ASDiv, SciQ and others (see the [model card](https://huggingface.co/Qiskit/mistral-small-3.2-24b-qiskit) for more info).

✅ **Improved UX**: More precise responses for quantum programming tasks.

✅ **Open access**: Available on Hugging Face → https://huggingface.co/Qiskit/mistral-small-3.2-24b-qiskit.

This update is part of our mission to make quantum development more intuitive and efficient. 🌟
