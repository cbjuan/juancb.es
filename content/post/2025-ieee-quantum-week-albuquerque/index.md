🚀 Excited to be attending IEEE Quantum Week in Albuquerque, New Mexico! I'll be sharing some of the work we're doing at IBM Quantum, especially at the intersection of AI and Quantum Computing. If you're around and passionate about Quantum, AI, or both—let's connect! Here's where you can find me:

🧠 Today, Sunday, August 31 – 4:00PM
Paper Presentation: "Quantum Processing Unit (QPU) Processing Time Prediction with Machine Learning". We'll explore how ML can improve QPU time prediction for quantum jobs—enabling smarter quantum workload scheduling.

🛠️ Monday, September 1 – 10:00AM
Tutorial: "TUT13 — AI Methods for Quantum Circuit Optimization". Together with David Kremer, we'll demonstrate how Reinforcement Learning can be used to transpile and synthesize quantum circuits, using qiskit-ibm-transpiler and other tools developed by our team.

💡 Tuesday, September 2 – 12:00PM
Live Demo at IBM Quantum Booth #400. I'll demo our new AI-powered quantum computing development environment—designed to bridge the gap between quantum theory and practical implementation in a visual way.

If you're attending and want to talk about AI for Quantum, Quantum+AI, or our work at IBM Quantum—feel free to reach out or stop by!
