I am thrilled and honored by the major announcements from IBM Quantum Summit 2023! 🚀

Key highlights advancing quantum utility:

**Hardware Breakthroughs:**
- IBM Heron chip: 3-5x device performance improvement over Eagle
- IBM Condor: 1,121-processor system demonstrating scaling solutions
- IBM Quantum System Two: Now operational at Yorktown Lab with 3 Heron processors

**Software Innovations:**
- Qiskit 1.0: Scheduled February release with improvements in circuit construction, compilation times, and memory consumption
- Quantum Serverless: Beta deployment for scaled pattern execution
- AI Integration: Automated code development via watsonx and enhanced transpiler tools

**Vision:** Extended roadmap through 2033

Academic and industry partners from University of Tokyo, Argonne National Lab, BasQ, and others showcased utility-scale quantum applications.

This represents tremendous progress toward realizing the full potential of quantum computing!
