🎓 Last Friday was a very special day - David Peral García successfully defended his PhD thesis!

This milestone holds special significance for me as my first doctoral thesis as an advisor, and I couldn't be prouder of David's groundbreaking work.

His research on Quantum Natural Language Processing represents what is likely the first PhD thesis in Spain dedicated to this emerging field, positioning him among the pioneers shaping the future of quantum computing and NLP.

David's contributions have already made a substantial impact in the research community, with notable publications including:

📄 A comprehensive survey on Quantum NLP in Computer Science Review: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cosrev.2024.100619 

📄 Novel applications in Expert Systems with Applications: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2024.124427

And there are more exciting contributions on the way that will further advance this fascinating intersection of quantum computing and language processing.

My deepest gratitude to the evaluation committee Mario Piattini, Anupama Ray, and Roberto Theron for their time, expertise, and valuable feedback, and to the co-advisor Francisco José García-Peñalvo for their essential collaboration throughout this journey.

Congratulations, Dr. Peral-García! 🎉

The future of Quantum NLP looks brighter with innovators like you leading the way.
