🚀 🚀🚀 Climbing the ranks in quantum software!

I'm thrilled to share that the `qiskit-ibm-transpiler` library has moved up to #3 in the [Unitary Foundation 2025 Survey under Full-stack development platforms, compilers, and simulators](https://unitaryfoundation.github.io/survey-2025/#full-stack-development-platforms-compilers-and-simulators-used-currently-or-in-the-future). Just last year, we [were #4](https://unitaryfoundation.github.io/survey-2024/#full-stack-development-platforms-compilers-and-simulators-used-currently-or-in-the-future) — and this year’s leap is a testament to the incredible work of the team behind it.

In less than two years, the package has surpassed [929K downloads](https://pepy.tech/projects/qiskit-ibm-transpiler), becoming a relevant tool for quantum circuit optimization/transpilation across the community.

One of the most exciting updates this year: our AI transpiler passes — including the latest Pauli Networks pass ([arXiv:2503.14448](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14448)) — can now run in local mode, removing the need for an IBM Quantum premium plan. This makes advanced AI-powered transpilation more accessible than ever.

The Unitary Fund survey is widely recognized as the primary pulse check for quantum software adoption and developer preferences. Seeing our work reflected there is both humbling and energizing.

Huge kudos to the amazing team behind this David Kremer, Víctor Villar Pascual, Jesús Talavera Gómez, Yaiza García Martín-Mantero, Ismael Faro — your dedication, creativity, and deep technical insight are what make this possible. And thank you to the community for your continued trust and feedback.

Let’s keep pushing the boundaries of quantum + AI software together.
