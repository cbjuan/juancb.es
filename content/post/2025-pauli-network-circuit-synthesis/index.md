Really happy to see the paper on arxiv. The described AI-powered transpiler pass for Pauli Networks has been available in the Qiskit Transpiler Service since last November 2024, as presented in the Quantum Developer Conference 2024 Check out the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14448 and the related documentation on how to use it https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/guides/ai-transpiler-passes#ai-circuit-synthesis-passes

**Context:** In response to [Ayushi Dubal's post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7308037457931833344/) about the Reinforcement Learning-based synthesis pass for Pauli Networks (Clifford + arbitrary angle Pauli rotation circuits). The research paper *Pauli Network Circuit Synthesis with Reinforcement Learning* was presented at the American Physical Society March Meeting in Anaheim.
