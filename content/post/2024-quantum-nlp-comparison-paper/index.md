Excited to share our peer-reviewed publication "Comparing Natural Language Processing and Quantum Natural Processing approaches in text classification tasks"! 🚀

This collaborative work with David Peral García and Francisco José García-Peñalvo has been published in *Expert Systems with Applications*.

Key findings:
- ✅ Quantum NLP models can obtain the same or better results in some datasets for simpler text classification tasks like entity recognition and sentiment analysis
- ✅ Performance diminishes with increased label complexity and sentence difficulty
- ✅ Experiments utilized up to 7 qubits and tested on both new and existing datasets across multiple classification scenarios

While the results are promising, we identified that advancing to larger-scale quantum applications requires more powerful quantum hardware and sophisticated software infrastructure.

This research contributes to our understanding of where quantum computing can provide advantages in natural language processing tasks and highlights the path forward for future developments.
