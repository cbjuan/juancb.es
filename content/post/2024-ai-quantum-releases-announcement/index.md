Exciting updates from our team at the convergence of AI and quantum computing! 🚀

We have released a bunch of new features in the Qiskit transpiler service and the Qiskit Code Assistant projects that continue unlocking the potential of applying classical AI into Quantum computing.

Recent releases include:
🔹 Beta version of the Qiskit transpiler service (unveiled at #THINK24)
🔹 Research paper on AI methods enabling AI-powered transpiler passes
🔹 Qiskit Code Assistant with accompanying paper introducing LLMs and the Qiskit HumanEval benchmark

Both projects have received recognition through the IBM Quantum Challenge, with fantastic feedback from participants who got to experience the power of AI-driven quantum optimization firsthand!

This work represents a major step forward in making quantum computing more efficient and accessible through the integration of artificial intelligence.
