Don’t have access to the Qiskit Code Assistant because you’re not on an IBM Quantum Premium plan?

No worries—you can run it directly on your computer! We’ve recently improved the local setup experience. With our scripts, you can:

- ✅ Download the LLM optimized for local enviroments (GGUF)
- ✅ Enable inference on your machine (through Ollama)
- ✅ Automatically configure the Qiskit Code Assistant VSCode or JupyterLab extension


Give it a try and share your feedback—we’d love to hear how you use it!
