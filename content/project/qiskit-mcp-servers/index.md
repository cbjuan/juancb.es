Production-ready Model Context Protocol servers that give AI assistants direct access to quantum computing infrastructure. Built on FastMCP with async-first architecture, full type safety, and 65%+ test coverage.

**Four specialized servers:**
- **Qiskit Server** — Circuit creation, manipulation, and transpilation
- **Code Assistant Server** — AI-assisted quantum programming via Granite models
- **IBM Runtime Server** — Hardware access, job execution, and backend selection
- **AI Transpiler Server** — RL-powered circuit optimization

Enables AI systems to autonomously generate quantum code, select optimal backends, execute circuits on real hardware, and provide expert quantum computing guidance—all through a standardized protocol.
