A library providing Gymnasium-compatible RL environments for quantum circuit optimization. Enables training AI agents to discover optimal circuit implementations for permutation synthesis, linear functions, and Clifford gates.

Features a high-performance Rust backend and integrates seamlessly with Qiskit. Powers the AI transpiler passes in qiskit-ibm-transpiler.
