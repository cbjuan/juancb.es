Speaking about my PhD experience and the career path that followed felt like coming full circle. It was inspiring to connect with brilliant doctoral candidates who are navigating their own research journeys. My main message? Make the most of your PhD years - they’re not just about the research, but about developing the critical thinking, resilience, and problem-solving skills that will serve you throughout your career. The energy and curiosity of the audience brought back memories of my own PhD days, which were truly an adventure. Getting to hang out with fellow PhD students and other speakers made the experience even more enriching"
