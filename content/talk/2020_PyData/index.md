abstract = "The project Jupyter (https://jupyter.org/) has revolutionized the world of research and data science in the last years. It comprises a lot of different subprojects, including the Jupyter Notebook web app, the kernels, the Docker images including modern data science software, JupyterHub, etc. A lot of people, researchers, and developers use software from this project each day, but, do we know how to take advantage of its full potential? In this talk, we will give a practical overview of the different features of Jupyter-related applications and environments, ranging the contents from the regular personal use to explain how to enable cooperative Jupyter environments for thousands of users."
