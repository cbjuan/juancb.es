abstract = "An approach for assisting in the generation of quantum source code. The approach may include receiving a quantum source code input with a specification of constraints of a quantum unit on which the quantum source code input is to be run, wherein the constraints include available quantum qubits or gates and/or available quantum parameters. The method creates a variation of the quantum source code input by analyzing the quantum source code input against trained models, wherein the variation includes adjustment of the quantum unit constraints depending on the specification of constraints the quantum unit. The method provides a recommendation based on the variation to assist in quantum source code generation."
