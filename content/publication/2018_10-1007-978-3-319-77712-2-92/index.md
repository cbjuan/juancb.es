abstract = "This paper presents a research work that analyzes the effect of redirecting users between two different versions of a web form after they have started the questionnaire. In this case, we used a web form proposed by the Spanish Observatory for Employability and Employment (OEEU) that is designed to gather information from Spanish graduates. These two versions are different as follows: one of them is very simple and the other one includes several changes that appeared in the literature related to users' trust, usability/user experience and layout design. To test the effect of redirecting users between both versions of the web form, we used a group of users that already have started the questionnaire and redirect them to the other version; this is, we changed the web form version they use to the other version and measure how this change affects them. This experiment has shown some promising results, which lead to enhance and extend the experience to bigger populations and other kind of changes in the user interfaces."
