abstract = "Under the development of the Digital Society and with the aim of achieving a true transition from the Information Society to the Knowledge Society, ICTs play a capital role in educational and knowledge management processes in any kind of entity, from Small and Medium-sized Enterprises to the Public Administration. The Spanish Public Administration is composed by a huge amount of the heterogeneous public organisms that range from research centres to public companies. The purpose of this paper is to provide an analysis about the knowledge management in the Spanish Public Administration through several real study cases developed in different public organisms. The analysis shows how the case studies follow the Suricata Architecture in order to identify success factors to replicate them in other public contexts."
