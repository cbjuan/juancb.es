abstract = "The advent of quantum computers makes it possible to perform quantum computations in different areas like machine learning, finance, or chemistry. This paper showcases one of the emerging areas under quantum machine learning, quantum natural language processing. We present two quantum natural language processing tasks, sentiment classification and missing word prediction in a sentence. We show how these tasks can be achieved even in real quantum computers using the two main libraries in this subfield, DisCoPy, and lambeq."
