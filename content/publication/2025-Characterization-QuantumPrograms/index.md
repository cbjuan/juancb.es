abstract = "Various systems and methods are presented herein regarding automatically utilizing characterized codes to characterize an undefined code. The undefined code can be computer instructions for implementation with a quantum computing system. Characterizing the undefined code with previously characterized codes enables knowledge of the undefined code to be acquired without the undefined code having to be executed on the quantum computing system. Prior to characterizing the undefined code, the undefined code can be converted from an original format (eg, high-level language) to a secure format (eg, low-level language), wherein the secure format cannot be reverse engineered back to the original format. The undefined code can be represented as a vector, with characterization based on a characterized code having a similar vector representation as the vector representation of the undefined code."
