abstract = "One or more systems, devices, computer program products and/or computer-implemented methods of use provided herein relate to a process to port code while adapting the code for a configuration of a target system. A system can comprise a memory that stores computer executable components, and a processor that executes the computer executable components stored in the memory, wherein the computer executable components can comprise an identification component that identifies a configuration of a target system on which a translated source code is to be executed, and a translation component that translates, based on a constraint defining the configuration, an original source code into the translated source code. In one or more embodiments, the translated source code can comprise a code language not comprised by the original source code and/or can be modified to align with the constraint, which can be of a hardware and/or software configuration."
