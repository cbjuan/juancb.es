abstract = "A computer-implemented system with machine learning capabilities designed to address quantum computing challenges. The system's recommendation component employs a machine learning model to generate, based on an input, a recommendation comprising a combination of entities comprising, one or more quantum circuits, one or more algorithms, one or more quantum hardware units, one or more error mitigation or error correction techniques, and one or more quantum procedures, to solve a defined problem. The system aims to assist researchers and practitioners by automating discovery of solutions through intelligent identification of optimal quantum algorithm combinations, hardware configurations, and error management strategies."
