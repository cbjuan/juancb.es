abstract = "Systems and techniques that facilitate Clifford circuit synthesis are provided. For example, one or more embodiments described herein can comprise a system, which can comprise a memory that can store computer executable components. The system can also comprise a processor, operably coupled to the memory that can execute the computer executable components stored in memory. The computer executable components can comprise a receiver component that receives a quantum circuit design comprising a Clifford circuit representation and one or more circuit restrictions, and a machine learning component that generates, using a machine learning model, a replacement circuit based on the one or more circuit restrictions and the Clifford circuit representation, and generates a modified quantum circuit design by replacing the Clifford circuit representation with the replacement circuit."
