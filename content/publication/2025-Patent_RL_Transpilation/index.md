abstract = "Systems and techniques that facilitate quantum circuit transpiling are provided. For example, one or more embodiments described herein can comprise a system, which can comprise a memory that can store computer executable components. The system can also comprise a processor, operably coupled to the memory that can execute the computer executable components stored in memory. The computer executable components can comprise a receiver component that receives an input quantum circuit representation and one or more quantum circuit constraints, a machine learning component that generates a transpiled quantum circuit representation based on the one or more quantum circuit constraints and the input quantum circuit representation."
